# FEUP-19

This game was developed as the preliminary project of the [Computer Games Development](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=459506) course @FEUP.

## Summary
Let's set the scene, you are a student at FEUP and it's past 10pm, the time at which COVID awakes! Waves of infected students invade the B building, you must neutralize the threat and destroy the source of the infection. At your disposal you have one of those hand sanitizers that sprays everywhere, you might also come accross some vaccines that will allow you to cure some of the infected. During your journey you may pick up some power-ups like: masks, score multipliers and gun modifiers.

This is a side-scrolling runner shooter type of game, with focus on coordination. The player needs to avoid obstacles (rubble piles, desks and chairs, ...) by jumping or sliding, dodge enemy projectiles, neutralize enemies, gather power-ups and make a path through the mayem that is the B corridor, all of this simultaneously.
